                <h2>Our commitment</h2>
                <p>We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make it easy
                    for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate
                    the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
                    challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers
                    and empower a global community of farmers through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also
                    offer training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating
                    only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native
                    growing region.</p>
